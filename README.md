# Microsoft Movie Analysis

**Author**: [Eric Wehmueller](mailto:ericwehmueller@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project is the first project for Flatiron School's bootcamp program in Data Science.  We are being placed into a hypothetical situation as a Data Scientist and hoping to provide value to our business for the scenario we are given.


## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. Our job is to explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Project Deliverables

* A GitHub repository
* A Jupyter Notebook
* A non-technical presentation


## Project Summary

After looking at the data and information available to us, I devised these questions that I believed could be answered through analysis and visualization.
***
* 1. Which genre(s) is most likely to receive the highest ratings?
* 2. Which budget range is best for avoiding profit losses?
* 3. Which genre(s) is most likely to be the most profitable?
***

I answer these questions in-depth in my movie-analysis.ipynb file contained within this repository via python code and visualizations.
